# About Digital Vegetable phenotyping

**Vegetable Phenotyping**
Vegetable phenotyping is the process of measurment of visible characteristics of vegetables, including their size, shape, color, and other physical traits. These characteristics, which are known as the vegetable's phenotype, are determined by both genetics and the environment. Vegetable phenotyping is often used in vegetables breeding and genetics research, as well as in the development of new varieties of vegetables. It can be used to assess vegetable's/plant's growth and development, identify genetic mutations, evaluate the effectiveness of different growing conditions and to determine the marketability of fruits.

**Conventional Vs Digital Phenotyping**
Conventional vegetable phenotyping involves the manual measurement and observation of plant characteristics by trained personnel e.g breeders. This can be done in the field or in a controlled greenhouse or laboratory setting. Digital phenotyping, on the other hand, uses sensors, cameras, lidars and other digital technologies to automatically collect data on vegetables characteristics. This data is then analyzed using algorithms to identify patterns and trends.
One key difference between the two approaches is the amount of data that can be collected and analyzed. Digital vegetable phenotyping can generate large amounts of data very quickly, which can be difficult to accomplish manually. This can allow for more detailed and accurate analysis of vegetables characteristics. Digital vegetable phenotyping also has the potential to be more efficient and accurate compated to conventional methods.
