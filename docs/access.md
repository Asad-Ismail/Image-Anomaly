Visit the Vegetable Phenotyping Support Channel [:material-microsoft-teams:](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a0d454e2ce7d94170bbf7d43854d0d770%40thread.tacv2/Digital%2520Phenotyping%2520Modeling%2520Support?groupId=90b4de3b-60d4-4569-8e47-bfae97775863&tenantId=fcb2b37b-5da0-466b-9b83-0014b67a7c78)

The Teams channel is the best way to reach the Vegetable Phenotyping Support team - as well as other users.
While you can also approach each of us individually, we prefer the Teams Channel above. This will make your question transparent to the whole team, and it will be read during vacation times.
